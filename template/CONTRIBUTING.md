## Add a project

If you like to suggest or add a project, choose one of the following ways:

- Suggest a project by opening an issue: Please use the suggest project template from the [issue page](https://github.com/best-of-lists/best-of-template/issues/new/choose) and fill in the requested information.
- Add a project by modifying the [projects.yaml](https://github.com/best-of-lists/best-of-template/blob/main/projects.yaml) and submitting a pull request with your addition. This can also be done directly via the [Github UI](https://github.com/best-of-lists/best-of-template/edit/main/projects.yaml).

Before opening an issue or pull request, please ensure that you adhere to the following guidelines:

- Please make sure that the project was not already added or suggested to this best-of list. You can ensure this by searching the projects.yaml, the Readme, and the issue list.
- Add the project to the `projects.yaml` and never to the `README.md` file directly. Use the yaml format and the properties documented in the [project properties](#project-properties) section below to add a new project, for example:
    ```yaml
    - name: Tensorflow
      github_id: tensorflow/tensorflow
      pypi_id: tensorflow
      conda_id: tensorflow
      labels: ["tensorflow"]
      category: ml-frameworks
    ```
- Please create an individual issue or pull request for each project.
- Please use the following title format for the issue or pull request: `Add project: project-name`.
- If a project doesn't fit into any of the pre-existing categories, it should go under the `Others` category by not assigning any category. You can also suggest a new category via the add or update category template on the [issue page](https://github.com/best-of-lists/best-of-template/issues/new/choose).

## Update a project

If you like to suggest or contribute a project update, choose one of the following ways:

- Suggest a project update by opening an issue: Please use the update project template from the [issue page](https://github.com/best-of-lists/best-of-template/issues/new/choose) and fill in the requested information.
- Update a project by modifying the [projects.yaml](https://github.com/best-of-lists/best-of-template/blob/main/projects.yaml) and submitting a pull request with your changes. This can also be done directly via the [Github UI](https://github.com/best-of-lists/best-of-template/edit/main/projects.yaml).

Before opening an issue or pull request, please ensure that you adhere to the following guidelines:

- Only update the project in the `projects.yaml` and never to the `README.md` file directly. Use the yaml format and the properties documented in the [project properties](#project-properties) section below to update a new project.
- Please create an individual issue or pull request for each project.
- Please use the following title format for the issue or pull request: `Update project: project-name`.
